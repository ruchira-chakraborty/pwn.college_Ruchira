DESCRIPTION
```
Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it:
When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchiko’s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.

WRITEUP
